Description: Provides automated downloading, parsing and formatting of weather
    data for Australia through API endpoints provided by the Department of
    Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) of Western Australia
    and by the Science and Technology Division of the Queensland Government's
    Department of Environment and Science (DES). As well as the Bureau of
    Meteorology (BOM) of the Australian government precis and coastal
    forecasts, agriculture bulletin data, and downloading and importing radar
    and satellite imagery files.  DPIRD weather data are accessed through public
    APIs provided by DPIRD, <https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/weather-api-20>,
    providing access to weather station data from DPIRD's weather station
    network.  Australia-wide weather data are based on data from the Australian
    Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) data and accessed through SILO (Scientific
    Information for Land Owners) (Jeffery et al., 2001,
    <doi: 10.1016/S1364-8152(01)00008-1>). DPIRD data are made available under
